# Resurrection
​​Resurrection ​is an intense​ 2d Souls-like platformer inspired by games like ​Celeste​ and ​Dark Souls​. 

Wielding only a sword and a trusty suit of armor, you must traverse a dangerous, brutal, and eerie landscape filled with secrets. Along your journey, you will face a variety of unique foes who stand in your way. 

To what exactly?... Nobody knows what lies ahead, after all no one has made it out alive.  Dying is inevitable and surviving is impossible. But escaping is unfathomable.
